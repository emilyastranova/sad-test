ESTABLISHING SHOT OF RELLIS CAMPUS, SUNRISE. PAN OVER TO CAMPUS BLDNG ACB-2
Big T is in room 314 with the Rellis gang, displaying his github prowess to the class

Big T (confidently): You can actually make pull requests to modify a repository, all I have to do is accept the request.

Dan: K that's cool but do you know what DHCP is? 

Big T: Of course I do, Dan, it's... wait... perhaps there's a gap in the knowledge base.

Austin (thinking long and hard): Yeah... I don't recall either.

Dan: Perhaps this is a huge conspiracy? Think about it: what does DHCP even do anyway? We require more explanation.

Big T: I... I don't know.

SUDDENLY, PROFESSOR KOTIKELA ENTERS THE CLASSROOM IN A HURRY

Kotikela: Big T! The campus has been hacked! An enemy organization exploited our DHCP service and took all of the school's funding, and NFTs!

Big T: There's nothing I can do professor, for I am simply underequipped to tackle this conundrum due to my insufficient memory base!

Kotikela: There must be something we can do! We are running out of vital time! Professor Hamad is doing everything she can with the Ironsight (TM) database
to counter the virus!

Nick (unsure of himself, but emboldened by unwarranted self confidence): I... I know what DHCP is! I can help professor! 

THE END
